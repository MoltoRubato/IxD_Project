## Project Overview
This project explores the design of a smart home app aimed at users who frequently travel or leave their homes unoccupied. The app focuses on providing seamless home security and maintenance functionalities, ensuring users can monitor and manage their homes remotely. The project is based on user research and iterative design processes.

## The project comprises three key documents:

### 1. **Motivations and Background Report**
- Discusses the rationale for the app, highlighting the need for home security and maintenance solutions for frequent travelers.
- Outlines background research, including surveys, interviews, and participatory design methods, that informed the app's concept.

### 2. **Design Report**
- Details the design process, including system requirements, personas, and use cases.
- Includes wireframe prototypes and descriptions of app features.
- Covers design decisions made based on user feedback and usability considerations.

### 3. **Personal Report**
- Reflects on individual team members' contributions and findings.
- Summarizes insights gained during the project, including challenges and lessons learned.

## Key Features of the App
- **Security Features:** Access to live camera feeds, emergency notifications, and remote control of smart devices.
- **Maintenance Features:** Tools for managing plants, pets, and other household systems requiring upkeep.
- **User-Friendly Design:** Intuitive navigation, FAQ section, and support for users with varying technical expertise.
